        <h1> MY PROFILE</h1>
        <p>Hello everyone! Welcome to my trial web design with profile information.</p>
        __________
            <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>First of all, my name is Do Ngoc Quynh Anh and I'm 19. Now, I am a freshman majoring in Software Engineering at FPT University - HCMC Campus. </p>
                <p>Lately, I'm diving into the content of Web Design. It seems to be boring at first, however, it's getting cooler and more fascinating. 
                    To be honest, HTML, I mean I've just learn this only in Web Design, is quite different compared to C, or Java, the way of organizing the code is different, when in HTML, there are a lot of text.</p>
                <p>And below is a picture of me.</p>
                <img src="MyImage.jpg" alt="My image">
